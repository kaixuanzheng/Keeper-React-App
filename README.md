# Keeper-React-App
In this project, I use React to create the app.
There are some highlights I like to mark:
1) Create different components in different JSX file such as App, Header, Footer, Note, and CreateArea.
2) Render all the notes inside notes.js as a separate Note component by the Map function.
2) Using the useState function to implement the add note and delete note functionality.
3) styling the website by the React UI library (Material UI).
4) get the image background on the Transparent Textures website.
